# spice-vdagent 0.23.0 can very occasionally ignore its normal stop request
# until systemd's 90-second service timeout expires.  The daemon carries no
# durable state, so retaining the distro unit while bounding only its stop
# phase is safer than allowing a desktop reboot to stall for several minutes.
